## Colcon ([source](https://gist.github.com/chapulina/7400a708df655cbfba218e169fcad97f#file-colcon_cheatsheet-md))

Only one package:

```bash
--packages-select <package>
```

Packages with regex:

```bash
--packages-select-regex <regex>
```

Verbose, print to console:

```bash
--event-handlers console_direct+
```

Run specific tests:

```bash
--ctest-args -R <part of test name>
```

Disable tests compilation:

```bash
--cmake-args -DBUILD_TESTING=false
```

Combine multiple CMake args:

```bash
--cmake-args ' -DBUILD_TESTING=false' ' -DENABLE_PROFILER=1'
```

Repeat test:

```bash
--retest-until-fail 10
```

Uninstall:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select <package> --cmake-target uninstall
```

Number of cores:

```bash
MAKEFLAGS="-j4" colcon build
```

Specific target, like `codecheck`:

```bash
--cmake-target codecheck
```

List all available targets for a project:

```bash
cd build/project_name
make help

## Release package via APT

Say you have a package called `apriltag_hitch_estimation` that you wish to release so that one may eventually acquire it with

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-apriltag-hitch-estimation
```

### Step 1

Place the package in a github repository under a branch called `$ROS_DISTRO-devel`. In this case `https://github.com/li9i/apriltag-hitch-estimation` under branch `humble-devel`. Then create an empty repository titled with the same name but append to it the string `-release`, e.g. `https://github.com/li9i/apriltag-hitch-estimation-release`.

### Step 2

Make sure the package's `package.xml` has a version, e.g.

```xml
<version>0.0.1</version>
```

Then create and push a Git tag matching that version

```bash
git tag -a 0.0.1 -m "Release 0.0.1"
git push origin 0.0.1
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The tag name must exactly match the version in `package.xml`

Then follow Guide A.

### Guide A

- [Releasing a Package / Index Your Packages](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Releasing/Index-Your-Packages.html)

Follow the guide. At some point you come across [Open a pull request to ros/rosdistro](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Releasing/Index-Your-Packages.html#open-a-pull-request-to-ros-rosdistro). Before requesting a pull visit the [REVIEW_GUIDELINES](https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/blob/master/REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md) and make sure to adhere to them. Then follow `1` and `2` from [Manually Authorizing Bloom to Generate Github Pull Requests](https://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/GithubManualAuthorization). Then [qwen's advice](https://chat.qwen.ai/s/dfa33c4a-8b08-4ecb-8fa3-a63ce24703a8?fev=0.0.248). 

Then run

```bash
bloom-release --rosdistro humble --track humble apriltag_hitch_estimation
```

Output

Could not determine release repository url for repository 'apriltag_hitch_estimation' of distro 'humble'
You can continue the release process by manually specifying the location of the RELEASE repository.
To be clear this is the url of the RELEASE repository not the upstream repository.
For release repositories on GitHub, you should provide the `https://` url which should end in `.git`.
Here is the url for a typical release repository on GitHub: https://github.com/ros-gbp/rviz-release.git
==> Looking for a release of this repository in a different distribution...

Repository Name:
  <name>
    Name of the repository (used in the archive name)
  upstream
    Default value, leave this as upstream if you are unsure
  ['upstream']:
```

```bash
<Enter>
```

```bash
Upstream Repository URI:
  <uri>
    Any valid URI. This variable can be templated, for example an svn url
    can be templated as such: "https://svn.foo.com/foo/tags/foo-:{version}"
    where the :{version} token will be replaced with the version for this release.
```

```bash
  [None]: https://github.com/li9i/apriltag-hitch-estimation.git
```

```bash
Upstream VCS Type:
  git
    Upstream URI is a git repository
  hg
    Upstream URI is a hg repository
  svn
    Upstream URI is a svn repository
  tar
    Upstream URI is a tarball
  ['git']:
```

```bash
<Enter>
```

```bash
Version:
  :{auto}
    This means the version will be guessed from the devel branch.
    This means that the devel branch must be set, the devel branch must exist,
    and there must be a valid package.xml in the upstream devel branch.
  :{ask}
    This means that the user will be prompted for the version each release.
    This also means that the upstream devel will be ignored.
  <version>
    This will be the version used.
    It must be updated for each new upstream version.
```

```bash
  [':{auto}']: 0.0.1
```

```bash
Release Tag:
  :{version}
    This means that the release tag will match the :{version} tag.
    This can be further templated, for example: "foo-:{version}" or "v:{version}"

    This can describe any vcs reference. For git that means {tag, branch, hash},
    for hg that means {tag, branch, hash}, for svn that means a revision number.
    For tar this value doubles as the sub directory (if the repository is
    in foo/ of the tar ball, putting foo here will cause the contents of
    foo/ to be imported to upstream instead of foo itself).
  :{ask}
    This means the user will be prompted for the release tag on each release.
  :{none}
    For svn and tar only you can set the release tag to :{none}, so that
    it is ignored.  For svn this means no revision number is used.
  [':{version}']:
```

```bash
<Enter>
```

```bash
Upstream Devel Branch:
  <vcs reference>
    Branch in upstream repository on which to search for the version.
    This is used only when version is set to ':{auto}'.
```

```bash
  [None]: humble-devel
```

```bash
ROS Distro:
  <ROS distro>
    This can be any valid ROS distro, e.g. humble, jazzy, kilted, rolling
  ['humble']:
```

```bash
<Enter>
```

```bash
Patches Directory:
  <path in bloom branch>
    This can be any valid relative path in the bloom branch. The contents
    of this folder will be overlaid onto the upstream branch after each
    import-upstream.  Additionally, any package.xml files found in the
    overlay will have the :{version} string replaced with the current
    version being released.
  :{none}
    Use this if you want to disable overlaying of files.
  [None]:
```

```bash
<Enter>
```

```bash
Release Repository Push URL:
  <url>
    (optional) Used when pushing to remote release repositories. This is only
    needed when the release uri which is in the rosdistro file is not writable.
    This is useful, for example, when a releaser would like to use a ssh url
    to push rather than a https:// url.
  :{none}
    This indicates that the default release url should be used.

Tip: Check to ensure that the debian tags created have the same version as the upstream version you are releasing.
Everything went as expected, you should check that the new tags match your expectations, and then push to the release repo with:
  git push --all && git push --tags  # You might have to add --force to the second command if you are over-writing existing tags

### Next steps

If the pull request is merged then the package will appear at https://index.ros.org/.

> Once your pull request has been submitted, usually within one or two days, one of the maintainers of rosdistro will review and merge your Pull Request. If your package build is successful, in 24-48 hours your packages will become available in the ros-testing repository, where you can [test your pre-release binaries](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Testing.html).

> Approximately every two to four weeks, the distribution’s release manager manually synchronizes the contents of ros-testing into the main ROS repository. This is when your packages actually become available to the rest of the ROS community. To get updates on when the next synchronization (sync) is coming, subscribe to the [Packaging and Release Management Category on ROS Discourse](https://discourse.openrobotics.org/c/ros/release/16).
